Assignment: Data Preprocessing and Hypothesis Testing
Objective: Perform comprehensive data preprocessing and hypothesis testing to analyze and refine the provided dataset.


The dataset contains details about customer preferences and purchases. The columns include:

CustomerID (Unique identifier for customers)
Age (Customer's age) ( 15 to 80 )
Gender (Male/Female/Other)
AnnualIncome (in $1000s)
SpendingScore (1â€“100, indicating spending habits)
PreferredCategory (Customer's preferred product category) (Valid categories are Electronics, Fashion, Home Decor, Sports, Groceries)


Activities

1. Missing Value Analysis
Check for missing values in the dataset.
Handle the missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean/mode imputation or removal).

2. Categorical Data Handling
Use pd.get_dummies to encode the categorical column(s) into numerical format.

3. Hypothesis Testing for Normality
Perform a Shapiro-Wilk test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check if numerical columns follow a normal distribution.
Report the p-values and interpret the results.

4. Hypothesis Testing for Correlation
Calculate the correlation matrix for numerical columns.
Perform a hypothesis test (e.g., Pearson's correlation test) for Age v/s Spending Score

5. Feature Elimination: Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests
Age v/s SpendinG Score
Annual Income v/s Spending Score

6. Chi-Square Test for Categorical Columns
Apply a Chi-Square test to evaluate the relationship between categorical columns and the target variable for feature elimination.
Gender v/s Spending Score
